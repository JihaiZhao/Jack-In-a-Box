## Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate a jack bouncing inside of a moving box. The drawing below shows the configuration and transformation of frames I used. For simulation, I simulate the jack starting at the center of the box with zero initial velocity and zero theta for 10 seconds with a time step of 0.01s.
