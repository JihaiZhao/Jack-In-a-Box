## Jack In a Box
# Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate a dice bouncing inside of a moving box. The drawing below shows the configuration and transformation of frames I used. For simulation, I simulate the dice starting at the center of the box with zero initial velocity and zero theta for 5 seconds with a time step of 0.01s.
